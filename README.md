# Roulette-with-Python

Developing this text game was really fun for me because of how much I personally enjoy the game of roulette. It was also a great opportunity to grow my knowledge of python and implment what I've learned into this project. 

# Strategy
My starting point for the project was to develop the game with the methods I was most comfortable with, since it's my first personal project. The program consists of defined functions for each bet and empty lists to store inputted data from the player. The idea is that the program asks the player one by one if they would like to bet in each of the 11 bets that the game of roulette has to offer. After placing how much money the player would like to wager, the input value is then compared to each bets unique function. Each defined function has a dictionary filled with every key-value pairs that covers the outcome of each unique bet. The tricky part was 

# Room for Improvement 
Although the program runs fine, there are a good amount of areas to improve on. 
To start the project lacks OOP (Object Oriented Programming). When I revisit this project I am looking to rework the whole defined function system in order to make the program more efficient for the sake of space complexity. 
Another area for improvement is utilizing NumPy in order to gain more familiary with the library while also achieving a faster running program. NumPy will hepl achieve a program that takes less memory to store and 

# Additional Features for the Future
I would love to implement the PyGame
